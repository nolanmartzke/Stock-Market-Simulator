Here you can document your coding standards and conventions. This includes decisions about naming, style guides, etc.

Some of the decisions we've made about how our code will be styled:

1. We will have both method headers and inline comments
2. We will use camel case for variable naming
3. We will utilize Prettier for code formatting and indentation
